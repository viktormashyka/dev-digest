# Skills

Reusable AI skills that provide specialized knowledge and workflows. Canonical location is `.claude/skills/` with a symlink at `.cursor/skills/ → ../.claude/skills` for Cursor compatibility. Shared with the team via version control.

## Catalog

| Skill | Scope | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| [onion-architecture](onion-architecture/SKILL.md) | Backend | Ring model for `server/` — dependency rule, ports, DI, routes as adapters |
| [fastify-best-practices](fastify-best-practices/SKILL.md) | Backend | Fastify routes, plugins, JSON-schema validation, error handling |
| [drizzle-orm-patterns](drizzle-orm-patterns/SKILL.md) | Backend | Drizzle schema, queries, relations, transactions, migrations |
| [postgresql-table-design](postgresql-table-design/SKILL.md) | Backend | Postgres schema design, data types, indexing, constraints |
| [frontend-ui-architecture](frontend-ui-architecture/SKILL.md) | Frontend | Where code lives — folder layout, feature boundaries, thin routes, `use client` boundary |
| [next-best-practices](next-best-practices/SKILL.md) | Frontend | Next.js App Router, RSC boundaries, data fetching, optimization |
| [react-best-practices](react-best-practices/SKILL.md) | Frontend | React anti-patterns, state management, hooks rules |
| [react-testing-library](react-testing-library/SKILL.md) | Frontend | General-purpose React Testing Library guide with Vitest |
| [zod](zod/SKILL.md) | Full-stack | Zod schema validation, parsing, error handling, type inference |
| [typescript-expert](typescript-expert/SKILL.md) | Full-stack | Type-level programming, performance, tooling, migrations |
| [security](security/SKILL.md) | Full-stack | OWASP Top 10:2025, auth, injection, uploads, secrets |
| [mermaid-diagram](mermaid-diagram/SKILL.md) | Shared | Mermaid diagrams in markdown (flowcharts, sequence, ERD, …) |
| [pr-self-review](pr-self-review/SKILL.md) | Project | Pre-PR review of the local diff; routes the skills above, gates on deterministic checks |
| [engineering-insights](engineering-insights/SKILL.md) | Project | Logs non-obvious lessons to the touched module's `LEARNINGS.md` |
| [implement-plan](implement-plan/SKILL.md) | Project | Runs implementer → plan-verifier (gate) → architecture-reviewer (fix loop) for an existing plan; spec-creator, implementation-planner, test-writer run separately |
| [workflow-retro](workflow-retro/SKILL.md) | Project | Retrospective on a multi-agent run's orchestration — tokens, agent order, handoffs, recommendations; distinct from engineering-insights, which logs code lessons to LEARNINGS.md |

## What Are Skills?

Skills are modular packages that extend the AI agent with specialized knowledge and workflows. Unlike rules (always applied) or agents (invoked for specific tasks), skills are loaded on-demand when the agent determines they're relevant.

### Skills vs Rules vs Commands vs Agents

| Type | Scope | Loaded | Purpose |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| **Rules** (`.mdc`) | Project conventions | Always or by file pattern | Persistent guardrails |
| **Commands** (`.md`) | User actions | On `/command` invocation | Slash commands |
| **Skills** (`.md`) | Domain knowledge | On-demand by agent | Specialized knowledge |
| **Agents** (`.md`) | Workflows | Via Task tool | Subagent orchestration |

## Creating New Skills

Each skill has:

- `SKILL.md` — Main skill file with rules and conventions (required)
- `examples.md` — Code examples showing good/bad patterns (recommended)
- `references.md` — Sources and rationale (optional)
