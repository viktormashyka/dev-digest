/**
 * Built-in skill catalogue used by the seed.

 * A skill is reviewer instructions and NOTHING else — no code, no tools, no
 * execution. Each body below is concatenated verbatim into the review prompt's
 * `## Skills / rules` section, at the same trust level as the agent's system
 * prompt. Keep them short: every line is tokens on every run.
 *
 * `description` is written imperatively on purpose — it is the skill's
 * interface, the sentence that tells a reader (and, once selection becomes
 * dynamic, the router) when the skill applies.
 *
 * NOT seeded here: `api-contract-guard` (Test Quality Reviewer, spec 02) and
 * `deprecation-policy` (API Contract Reviewer, specs/03). Both are imported
 * live through the UI's preview-then-confirm flow so the import path gets
 * exercised end to end — see `demo-assets/deprecation-policy.SKILL.md`.

Evaluate the pull request against the following dimensions. For each, return a
finding only when the issue is **worth the author's time** — aim for 5
high-signal findings, not 50.

## Correctness
- Does the change do what the PR description claims?
- Are edge cases (empty input, nulls, concurrency) handled?

## Security
- Any secrets, tokens, or credentials in the diff?
- Untrusted input reaching a sink (SQL, shell, fetch)?

## Tests
- New branches covered by assertions?
- Are tests meaningful (not just snapshot churn)?

## Scope
- Does the diff do only what it says, or has unrelated work crept in?`,

A change is dangerous when it brings together all THREE of:

1. **Private data access** — reads secrets, user records, internal APIs, the filesystem
2. **Untrusted input** — request bodies, PR/issue text, scraped pages, model output
3. **An exfiltration path** — outbound HTTP, logging, a webhook, writing somewhere shared

Any two of these are ordinary. All three in one code path is the pattern behind
most agent data-leak incidents. When you find all three, report ONE finding that
names each leg and cites the line where it enters.`,

test in the diff exercises it.

Report a finding for each branch with no covering assertion. Name the branch and
the line, and say which input would reach it.

exactly this finding: the error branch is untested. Do not accept "the happy
path is tested" as coverage of a conditional.`,

- **Over-mock** — so much is stubbed that the test would pass even if the real
  implementation were deleted
- **Depend on wall-clock time** — \`Date.now()\`, \`setTimeout\`, or a sleep, without
  fake timers; these are the flakes that fail only in CI
- **Depend on execution order** — shared mutable state between tests, or an
  assertion that relies on the previous test having run

Flag any change in the diff that a caller outside this diff cannot safely
ignore: a removed or renamed route, a removed or renamed exported
function/type, a request parameter that became required, or a parameter/field
that was removed.

**Bad** — an existing caller silently breaks:

// before: GET /users/:id
// after:
app.get('/users/:userId', handler); // route param renamed, callers 404

**Good** — the old shape keeps working, or the break is explicit and versioned:
\`\`\`ts
app.get('/users/:id', handler);
app.get('/users/:userId', handler); // alias added, nothing removed

Flag any change to what a route or function RETURNS to a caller: a field
removed, renamed, or made optional→required or required→optional in the wrong
direction, or a field's type changed (e.g. \`string\` → \`string | null\`,
\`number\` → \`string\`).

**Bad** — a caller reading \`user.email\` breaks or gets undefined behaviour:
\`\`\`ts
// before: { id, name, email }
return { id, name }; // email silently dropped from the response
\`\`\`

**Good** — the field stays, or its removal is called out as a breaking change
elsewhere in this review (see \`breaking-change\`):
\`\`\`ts
return { id, name, email: user.email ?? null }; // shape preserved

wider type) is not breaking; the reverse direction is. Report breaking

When this diff touches a published package's public API (exported functions,
types, routes) in a way that breaks an existing caller, check whether the
version bump (package.json, CHANGELOG, or PR title) reflects a MAJOR change.

**Bad** — a breaking change shipped as a patch/minor:
\`\`\`diff
- "version": "2.4.1"
+ "version": "2.4.2"   // but a required param was added to an exported fn
\`\`\`

**Good** — the bump matches the change:
\`\`\`diff
- "version": "2.4.1"
+ "version": "3.0.0"   // major bump for the breaking signature change
\`\`\`

public contract, and (2) a version file or changelog entry that under-bumps
it. Report at WARNING — this is a discipline check, not a correctness bug —
and name the specific breaking change that justifies the higher bump.`,
