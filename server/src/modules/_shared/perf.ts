 * specs/16-agent-performance-dashboard.md — pure aggregation helpers shared by

 * per-agent Stats tab (`modules/agents/service.ts`). Both read the SAME
 * underlying query (`CiRepository.performanceRows`, scoped to all agents or
 * one) and derive figures through the SAME functions here, so AC-1 ("same
 * API, same rules") is structural rather than described in prose.
 *
 * `_shared` is `no-cross-module`-exempt (`server/.dependency-cruiser.cjs`),
 * but that exemption only covers OTHER modules importing FROM here — this
 * file itself must not import another module's types (the rule still fires
 * on `_shared -> ci` edges). `PerfSourceRow` below is therefore a LOCAL
 * structural mirror of `ci/repository.ts`'s `PerfRangeRow`, not an import of
 * it — the real row type satisfies this shape structurally with zero cast.
